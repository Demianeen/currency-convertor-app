# Currency convertor

Pocket converters are always necessary, no matter where you live. Therefore, I made it for you.

This app was created as a test assignment for one company. The app is a simple currency converter. Now I try to make it even better by utilizing new technologies and my brain.

The main tech stack I used:

- React
- Typescript
- Redux + Redux toolkit
- RTK Query
